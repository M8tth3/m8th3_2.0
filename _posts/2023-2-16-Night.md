## Reflection on glows/grows from your demo
- Overall, I thought the demo went very well. We were able to demonstrate all of our integrated features and there were minimal bugs during the demo. Furthermore, we received lots of great feedback from both "techy" and non-techy parents and other csp/csa students as well. However, there are still many improvements to be made. During the demo, we found out that there were some features that were not as intuitive to others. For example, on our main baking screen some people weren't sure what to drag and drop. Also, the drag and drop was quite slow so in the future we're planning on having a feature where you simply type in the ingredient you want to put in.

## Something you saw in CompSci that impressed
- I was very surprised at the variety of creative ideas that were developed amongst the students and the many different routes students took even though they were given the same starting code. The unbelievable amount of unique features that I saw were amazing, especially since most of these groups finished their projects over a few last-minute late night sessions. One group in particular had create a youtube-like media platform that I found to be super impressive because it was an actually useful project that I thought might be used on a daily basis. 
## Something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked
- The overall organization and ecstatic energy during N@M was super impressive. As well as the number of enthusiastic parents who were very engaged and there were a surprising amount of "techy parents" too.
