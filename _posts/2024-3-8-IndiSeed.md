## Group Work
> Worked individual features separately while keeping team members updated. Consistently integrated via pull requests for refinement once features were completed. 

## CPT Project Feature
> My feature is the usage of the ingredients the user holds and the dragging and dropping of those ingredients to be baked. My feature sends a GET request to the backend and retrieves the current ingredients/recipes the user has then displays it on the frontend to be used for baking.
