## CPT Project Overview
> "Let-m-Cook" is a baking game in which the user navigates the website, baking, trading, and buying ingredients/recipes. The main focus of the game is its baking aspect in which the user tries out different combinations of ingredients to create recipes. Most of these recipes can be used to create more recipes as well.

## Individual Features
> My feature is the usage of the ingredients the user holds and the dragging and dropping of those ingredients to be baked. My feature sends a GET request to the backend and retrieves the current ingredients/recipes the user has then displays it on the frontend to be used for baking. 

## College Board Requirements

- **Instructions for input from the user**

> On this page the user is able to drag and drop any ingredient they own into the pan to be baked. They are also able to clear the pan in case they want to use a different set of ingredients.

> Javascript code that creates a dropzone for the user to drop an item in. [DropZone Commit](https://github.com/trevorhuang1/lmc-frontend/commit/accd3ac5fd3623e7ce8d2cbff7e711e00d01d482)


- **Use at least one list(or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program's purpose**

> Whenever the user loads on to the baking page a GET request is sent to the backend to reference the item's column so that the frontend can display what ingredients the user currently has. The image directly above is a picture of the schema and the "item's column."

- **At least one procedure that contributes to the program's intended purpose, where you have defined: the procedure's name, the return type, one or more parameters**

> This is the bake function that checks what elements are currently inside of the pan that way they can be cross-referenced with our baking api later to determine what recipe needs to be created. The procedure's name is bake, and when the procedure is run it redirects the user to another page. [Baking Commit](https://github.com/trevorhuang1/lmc-frontend/commit/3c8fc2ea23bd691cd909b9ba391723b6529a9290)
- **An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure**

> This section of the bake function iterates through each section of the baking pan. It then appends whatever elements reside in each section into an array. [Baking Commit](https://github.com/trevorhuang1/lmc-frontend/commit/3c8fc2ea23bd691cd909b9ba391723b6529a9290)
